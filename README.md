## üß™ How to Run the Project

### Requirements:
- Node.js v14+
- MongoDB
- Chrome browser (for extension)
- API Keys for Groq and Gemini

### Environment Setup:
Create a `.env` file in the Backend directory with:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

### Local Setup:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Sumit2424/CloneIT.git
cd CloneIT

# Install Backend dependencies and start server
cd Backend
npm install
npm start

# In a new terminal, install Frontend dependencies and start dev server
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Install Browser Extension:
# Open Chrome > chrome://extensions > Enable Developer Mode > Load Unpacked > Select BrowserExtension folder

#SnaPclone Ide 
# Snapclone IDE ->Frontend
cd SnapClone/frontend
npm install
npm run dev

#Snapclone Ide ->Backend
cd SnapClone/be
npm install
npm start

```


### Usage Notes:
- Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173 (or port specified by Vite)
- Backend API runs on http://localhost:5000
- Make sure both servers are running to use the application properly
- Chrome extension needs to be installed separately as described above

## üèÅ Final Words
Our hackathon journey with CloneIT was really fun and full of challenges.
From setting up smart AI models to building a working browser extension, we had to think fast and learn a lot.

We faced real problems ‚Äî like fixing messy website data and connecting the extension to AI ‚Äî but every problem taught us something new.
There were late nights, bugs we didn't expect, and last-minute changes, but that made it even more exciting.

We're proud that CloneIT went from just an idea to a real tool that can help developers save time and work faster.
Big thanks to our mentors, friends, and teammates for supporting us all the way.

This was more than a project ‚Äî it's a memory we'll always remember!
